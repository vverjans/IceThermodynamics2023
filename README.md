# IceThermodynamics2023
This repository is associated with the ice thermodynamics chapter of the course "Glacier and Ice Sheet Dynamics" (Georgia Institute of Technology, spring 2023).

The notebook solutionRobin.ipynb includes the theory and the code for the Robin model. The code allows to make a simple sensitivity study of the influence of different variables on a vertical ice temperature profile.

The notebook modelTemperatureEvol.ipynb is associated with the practical. The exercise connsists of modeling the evolution of the ice temperature profile at Summit Station (Greenland). We use a reconstruction of past temperature as forcing. And we compare the final modeled profile to ice core temperature observations from the GRIP core.

The document vanLiefferinge_2018.pdf is the publication of van Liefferinge et al. (2018): "Promising Oldest Ice sites in East Antarctica based on thermodynamical modelling". We discuss and analyze this study in class.
